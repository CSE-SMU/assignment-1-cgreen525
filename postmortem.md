# Assignment 1 Postmortem
### Christian Green

## What's your past experience with front-end development?
### I have done a very minimal amount of front-end development - meaning I have only experienced it through building my own personal website using bootstrap, and I have also watched as my teammates from the GUI class last semester worked on their end.


## How difficult was this assignment?
### I found it very simple - since it was clearly written out for us.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
### I learned that you cannot always copy & paste clearly.  I tried copying the pieces of code together, but it turned out that the " " symbols were different between my computer and what was being copied to the clipboard.  This caused a few initial errors.


## How could this assignment be improved?
### I like the idea of starting simple, but I feel like some more CSS would have made the assignment more interesting.


## Any other comments?
### Not this time!
